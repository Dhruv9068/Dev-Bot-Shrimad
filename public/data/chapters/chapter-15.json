  "summary": "Chapter 15 describes the nature of the supreme spirit and the eternal tree of worldly existence. Krishna explains the eternal ashvattha tree (symbolizing samsara) with its roots above and branches below. He describes how to cut down this tree with the axe of detachment and take refuge in the Supreme Person. The chapter culminates in the revelation of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Purushottama), beyond both the perishable (kshara) and imperishable (akshara) beings.",

      "explanation": "Krishna describes the eternal tree of material existence (samsara) as an inverted ashvattha (sacred fig) tree with its roots in the spiritual world and branches extending downward into the material world.

      "translation": "The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is.

One must use detachment (non-attachment to sense objects) as an axe to cut down this tree of material existence and seek the eternal spiritual realm, surrendering to the Supreme Person (Krishna) who is the source of everything."
